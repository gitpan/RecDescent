NAME

    Parse::RecDescent - generate recursive-descent parsers


DESCRIPTION

    RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
    parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It provides:

        * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),

        * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,

        * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions,

        * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,

        * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,

        * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
          productions during a parse,

        * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),

        * The ability to retrieve the generated parsing code.

    See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.


LIMITATIONS

    * There's no support for parsing directly from an input stream.

    * The generator doesn't handle left-recursion.


PREREQUISITES

    Parse::RecDescent requires Text::Balanced, which is included in the
    distribution.


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectories.


CHANGES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

    This is version 1.00, so no there are changes yet. For possible future
    directions see the appropriate section in "RecDescent.pod".
