NAME

    Parse::RecDescent - generate recursive-descent parsers


DESCRIPTION

    RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
    parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It provides:

        * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),

        * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,

        * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions,

        * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,

        * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,

        * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
          productions during a parse,

        * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),

        * The ability to retrieve the generated parsing code.

    See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.


LIMITATIONS

    * There's no support for parsing directly from an input stream.

    * The generator doesn't handle left-recursion.


PREREQUISITES

    Parse::RecDescent requires Text::Balanced, which is included in the
    distribution.


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectories.
