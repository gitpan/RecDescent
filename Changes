Revision history for Perl extension Parse::RecDescent.

1.00  Mon Aug 11 13:17:13 1997

	- original version


1.01  Mon Sep  8 18:04:14 EST 1997

	- changed "quotemeta" to "quotemeta $_" in Text::Balanced
	  to workaround bug in Perl 5.002 and 5.003


1.10  Tue Sep 30 14:51:49 EST 1997

	- fixed fatal bug in tracing code

	- added m<delim>...<delim> format for regex tokens

	- added support for trailing modifiers (/.../gimsox) in regex tokens

	- added $thisline variable


1.20  Thu Oct  2 11:46:57 EST 1997

	- fixed handling of trailing regex modifiers (now no whitespace allowed
	  before between last delimiter and first modifier)

	- added trace diagnostic for failure/success of actions
	  (demystifies failures caused by an action returning undef)

	- added context for "Matched rule..." trace

        - added a test so that an integer value (N>1) in the
          $::RD_TRACE variable now truncates (to N characters) all
          contexts reported in any trace

	- added "start-up" actions: actions appearing before the first rule
          were previously an error. They are now executed (once) at
          the start of the parser's namespace.


1.21  Sat Oct  4 17:12:23 EST 1997

	- modified truncation of context in trace diagnostics (successful
	  matches now report first N/2 and last N/2 chars, instead of first N)

	- fixed incorrect version number in Balanced.pm


1.22  Tue Oct  7 11:53:27 EST 1997

	- fixed lurking trace problem with certain pathological regexes

	- fixed bug in generation of special namespaces (this was serious
	  as it prevented the use of more than one alternation in a parser,
	  as well as preventing the use of more than one parser in a script!


1.23  Fri Oct 17 10:15:22 EST 1997

	- fixed error message generation for <error?:msg> directives

	- fixed error message handling of empty productions

	- fixed handling of multi-line start-up actions

	- removed spurious debugging message for implicit subrule generation

	- changed naming scheme for alternations (pseudo-rule's name now
	  describes location of alternation exactly)

	- added support for repetition specifiers on alternations.

	- Text::Balanced::extract_.... altered to honour the context in
	  which they are called (see Balanced.pod for details).


1.24
	- fixed minor problem in tracing code (context string now correctly
	  reported for actions)

	- added explicit namespace declaration at beginning of generated
	  code, to ensure that any "start code" is declared in the
	  appropriate namespace.

	- fixed left recursion check on empty productions

	- added $::RD_AUTOSTUB flag and associated autostubbing behaviour
	  (see new section - "Autostubbing" - in RecDescent.pod)

	- eliminated hierarchical precedence between $::RD_HINT and 
          $::RD_TRACE. Enabling tracing now does _not_ automatically
          turn on hinting (although error and warning messages are
          still automatically enabled).

	- fixed bug in Text::Balanced. Division now correctly handled
	  in code blocks.
