1.00  Mon Aug 11 13:17:13 1997
	- original version

1.01  Mon Sep  8 18:04:14 EST 1997
	- changed "quotemeta" to "quotemeta $_" in Text::Balanced
	  to workaround bug in Perl 5.002 and 5.003

1.10  Tue Sep 30 14:51:49 EST 1997
	- fixed fatal bug in tracing code
	- added m<delim>...<delim> format for regex tokens
	- added support for trailing modifiers (/.../gimsox) in regex tokens
	- added $thisline variable

1.20  Thu Oct  2 11:46:57 EST 1997
	- fixed handling of trailing regex modifiers (now no whitespace allowed
	  before between last delimiter and first modifier)
	- added trace diagnostic for failure/success of actions
	  (demystifies failures caused by an action returning undef)
	- added context for "Matched rule..." trace
        - added a test so that an integer value (N>1) in the
          $::RD_TRACE variable now truncates (to N characters) all
          contexts reported in any trace
	- added "start-up" actions: actions appearing before the first rule
          were previously an error. They are now executed (once) at
          the start of the parser's namespace.
